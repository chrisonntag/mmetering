; May be one of false, unexpected, or true. If false, the process will never
; be autorestarted. If unexpected, the process will be restart when the program
; exits with an exit code that is not one of the exit codes associated with this

; When resorting to send SIGKILL to the program to terminate it
; send SIGKILL to its whole process group instead,
